# OpenCL-C-and-Matlab-3D-Wave-Equation-simulation
This project contains of two small programs. One is written in C++ and it is an implementation of 3D wave equation using DFT method. Calculations are made on GPU using OpenCL. Second program is a small Matlab script just to show the calculations results.
